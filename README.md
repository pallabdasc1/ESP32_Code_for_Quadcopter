ðŸš€ Open Source Quadcopter Flight Controller â€“ ESP32 Port

===================================================================================



ðŸ“œ License & Acknowledgement:

This code is inspired and adapted from the **Carbon Aeronautics Flight Controller Manual**, originally designed for the **Teensy 4.0** microcontroller. The core logic and architecture were retained while porting the implementation to the **ESP32-WROOM-DevKit** platform using the **Arduino framework**.



This project was created for **educational and experimental purposes only**. All credits to Carbon Aeronautics for their excellent open-source initiative. I do not intend to use any part of this code for commercial applications.



ðŸ“¡ Key Components:

- **ESP32-WROOM-DevKit v3**

- **MPU6050 IMU Sensor** (I2C)

- **FlySky PPM Receiver** (decoded via `PPMReader` library)

- **FreeRTOS Tasks** for flight control and battery monitoring

- Dual-loop **PID control** for roll, pitch, and yaw stabilization

- PWM motor control using `ledcWrite()` for ESCs
